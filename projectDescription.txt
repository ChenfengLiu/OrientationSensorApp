A utility app that will help people tracking the orientation of any object.

(30 points) Basic Activities and layouts in Android app.

(30 points) Basic bluetooth functions (be able to connect to arduino via bluetooth).

(30 points) Arduino Library for calculating object orientation.

(30 points) Display orientation data, which received from arduino in real-time.

(30 points) Display 3D model with in real-time on Android Device screen.




Technical Criteria: 
1. Android Features: bluetooth, 3D graphics
2. Arduino Features: bluetooth, 9 DoF sensors


Design Critial: 
1. Create a new Arduino Library



week1: setup bluetooth communication with arduino (part 1)
week2: write algorithm to calculate object orientation in arduino library (part 2)

week3: combine part 1 and 2, finish with displaying 3D model to indicate the object orientation.
